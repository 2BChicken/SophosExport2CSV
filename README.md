# SophosExport2CSV
Converting Entities.XML from Sophos export to csv-files
A little side-project to get a better overview for the configurations from the export file from Sophos. The compatiblity to older versions of SPFW can't be guaranteed and the focus is on Version 21.0 or above. 
Here is the direct link to the docu for Version 21.0:
